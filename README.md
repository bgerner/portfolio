# Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio - consisting of a main page with an "about me", "work", "contact", and "resume" section.
There are a number of css styles applied throughout the page as well as specific media queries at 4 different max-widths to make the page look clean as the screen size decreases.
As you can see in certain commented out sections of the HTML, I attempted to use Bootstrap having not gone over it at all in class, and just ended up wasting hours of my time trying to figure it out before scrapping it altogether and getting the job done with flex-boxes.
